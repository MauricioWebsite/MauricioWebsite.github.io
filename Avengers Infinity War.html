   <div id="About the Movie">
    <h2 class="thesize">About the Movie</h2>
     <p class="mainbody">This movie is a culmination of ten years of movies. These movies have all been leading to this where the "Avengers","The Guardians of the Galaxy",and many others come together to stop a threat. In reality though this movie isn't about them its about this threat which is called "Thanos".
        "Thanos" is the main character of the story he's the one we see struggle obstacles to get his goal. His goal which is to wipe out have of the living universe so the other half may live. This shows that he has a goal that he feels is truly right and he should act on. The real threat is the
        Heroes trying to stop thanos from achieving his goal. Thanos isn't the hero though he is just the main character. "Infinity war" is just the setup though for the next Avengers movie which comes out next year.</p>

   <div id="Characters">
    <h2 class="thesize">Characters</h2>
     <img class="pics" src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/8/2/128d73d4-d883-4c55-8a27-fc793a1b8aa9-1-min-13.jpg?w=945&h=574&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70"/>
      <p class="mainbody"> The Characters each have a moment to shine in this movie like "Captain America's" introduction in the movie,or like "Thor" entering wakanda at the end. They each go a moment to come out and show their abilities and personality. It does it very well since the movie had to give 20 characters
          The spotlight to show why these movies are so great. The Actors also gave very powerful performances in the movie such as Josh Brolin as "Thanos" and Zoe Saldana as"Gamora",(Thanoses daughter), which made the audience really feel. There were some standouts with characters though like "Thor"
          and "Thanos".I give the characters in the movie an 8/10.</p>
   <div id="Plot">
    <h2 class="thesize">Plot</h2>
     <img class="pics" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/T8m5HwcNS769aMHCIb_lXFMek7o/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/04/26/640/n/1922283/tmp_sFnes9_6807fd5b51198b20_InfinityWar5ac2dbd3a2f43.jpg"/>
      <p class="mainbody">The plot is great,because it's about this man who wants the universe to be safe from killing itself. After seeing his own planet from overpopulation. That's why the "Avengers" and "Guardians of the Galaxy" want to stop "Thanos from collecting the stones. "Thanos" in the end he is actually
         able to get all the stones and wipe out half of the universe. This is the reason why I like the ending it has the villain actually winning in the end. The movie had a lot of emotional scenes,but the end is the most emotion. This is because half of the characters that we've grown to love die in
         a snap of "Thanos's" fingers,literally,and other characters slowly realizing what happened. I give the plot 9/10. </p>

     <p class="mainbody"> I really like this movie there's no doubt about it,but this isn't the best Marvel movie. I definitely think that "Captain America the Winter Soldier" is still the best Marvel movie. This movie is still really good and is probably the second best Marvel movie. I definitely think this is a great movie and that everyone
         that made it must be proud. This movie does have some faults such as:</p>
      <ul>
       <li class="points">Plot holes</li>
       <li class="points">Too long for some</li>
       <li class="points">Real graphic for kids</li>
     </ul>
     <p class="mainbody"> These are the only complaints I have for this movie. There would be things I would like to be different but other than that it's still really good. I will put a link below to so if you would like to buy "Avenger Infinity War" on "Bluray" or DVD.</p>
