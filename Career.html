  <p class="mainbody">
    When I was a child there were many ideas going through my head to what I wanted to be. Now that I am older I am very unsure to what i would want to be.
    There's many things I could be,but what would I actually enjoy. For me this idea that I must enjoy my job has left,and instead I would want a job that pays well.
    Currently as of 2018 I am a sophmore and age 15. At this time I have not played any sports for the school years of highschool and middle school. I do not have a career goal
    as of now,but I am sure eventually i'll have one. In terms of education I have passed all my classes in the past years,and doing so right now. I do indeed plan to go to college,but
    I do not know where. My future life as you can see is a bit unorganized,but I know I will work hard to get through life.

    <p class="mainbody">Even though I don't have a clear objective in life of what I want to work as. I've always had the dream of becoming a director. This has been my dream
    for several years. This is very high goal because there are many others who have this same ambition. This desire comes from my love of films and what they show. They can make people feel
    like the director wants. They can also influence how people view on things. This goal is very high and there are many risks that comes with trying to achieve this goal. Which is one of the
    reasons that I don't really want to pursue this goal.  </p>
